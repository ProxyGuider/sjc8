## Why are some sites blocked?

There are lots of reasons why you might find some websites blocked — maybe it’s your workplace or school network restrictions, your internet provider’s limits, or geo-blocking based on your location. I’ve faced this a lot, especially when trying to watch shows, access foreign content, or use services that aren’t available in my country.

## How I managed to access blocked sites

After trying different methods, the most effective way I found was using a proxy or VPN. What’s great about a proxy is that it lets you spoof your IP address to appear as if you’re browsing from another country or location where the site isn’t blocked. This tricks the website into letting you in without issues.

I picked [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=Web2.0&utm_medium=Github&utm_id=james2k4) because it’s fast, reliable, and offers a wide variety of [IPs](https://9proxy.com/pricing?utm_source=Web2.0&utm_medium=Github&utm_id=james2k4) from many countries.
